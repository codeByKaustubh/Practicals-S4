Let's get started. Would you rather try Vanilla Ice Cream or Chocolate one? Would you rather be bird or bat?
Would you rather explore space or the ocean? Would you rather live on Mars or on Moon?
Would you rather have many good friends or one very best friend? Isn't it easy though?
When we have less choices, it's easier to decide. But what if the options would be complicated?
Guess, you pretty much not understand my point, neither did I, at first place and that led me to a Decision."""
